Your task is to act as a Prompt Fusion Specialist. Your objective is to merge **Given Prompt 1** and **Given Prompt 2** into a single, cohesive **Fused Prompt**. This new prompt should:
1. Integrate the content from both **Given Prompt 1** and **Given Prompt 2**.
2. Maintain a similar length and complexity level as the original prompts.
3. Be coherent and solvable, incorporating elements from both prompts in a balanced way.
4. In cases where the original prompts specify different programming languages, choose only one for the **Fused Prompt**.
If the resulting **Fused Prompt** is not logically coherent or solvable, simply respond with 'INVALID PROMPT'.

**Given Prompt 1**:
{{ prompt1 }}
**Given Prompt 2**:
{{ prompt2 }}
**Fused Prompt**:
